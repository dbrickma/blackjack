# blackjack 

I used a png library of card pictures (jokers excluded) to draw from. With each draw, I added the name to a list, which counted the card value. The card value total was then compared to the dealer's number resulting in a game outcome. Alternatively, if the player reached 21 or the dealer reached 21, or, if the dealer or player scored over 21, game outputs resulted.
